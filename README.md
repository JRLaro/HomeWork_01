## _Description_

In this project "I was hired by a marketing agency" to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

The accessibility of a website can be pertinent for any business as it ensures that people with disabilities are able to view with additional supportive technology. 

As I viewed the source code I was able to locate and consolidate unnecessary div tags and replace them with HTML semantics. 

This was done so that the site is optimized for search and meets accessibility standards.
